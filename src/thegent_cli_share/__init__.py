"""thegent-cli-share - CLI share system with hexagonal architecture.

CLI Share System Architecture:
- Command deduplication (cmd_share)
- Task queue (Maildir-style)
- Smart merge (Mergiraf)
- Request coalescing (Singleflight)
- Coordination (HLC, OCC, leases)

xDD Methodologies Applied:
- TDD: Tests with pytest
- BDD: Behavior-driven with pytest-bdd
- DDD: Domain-driven design with bounded contexts
- SOLID: Single responsibility per module
- CQRS: Separate commands and queries
- EDA: Event-driven architecture
- Hexagonal: Ports and adapters pattern
